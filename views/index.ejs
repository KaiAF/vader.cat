  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Vader was born sometime in 2017 and was homeless.<br>
    He came to my family with his brother, Garfield. They both were young but clearly in need of a home. We promptly took them in, and the rest is pretty much history.
  </p>
  <p>Vader is a very relaxed cat and enjoys being petted on his face.</p>
  <p>Most photos of him are blurry for some reason, the camera seems to not like to focus on his face. ðŸ˜º</p>
  <p>Vader is currently ~<%= (new Date().getFullYear()) - 2017 %> years old.</p>
